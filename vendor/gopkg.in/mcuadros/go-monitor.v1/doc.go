/*
The main goal of `go-monitor` is provide a simple and extensible way to build
monitorizable long term execution processes or daemons via HTTP.

Thanks to the defaults `aspects` you can monitorize parameters as runtime,
memory, etc. for any Go processes and daemons. As well you can create your
custom `aspects` for monitorize custom parameters from your applications.
