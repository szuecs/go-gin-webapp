# Gin-OAuth2

[![Go Report
Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/zalando/gin-oauth2)](https://goreportcard.com/report/zalando/gin-oauth2) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zalando/gin-oauth2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zalando/gin-oauth2) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/gin-oauth2?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/gin-oauth2)


Gin-OAuth2 is specially made for [Gin Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
users who also want to use OAuth2. It was created by Go developers
who needed Gin middleware for working with OAuth2 and couldn't find
any.

## Project Context and Features

When it comes to choosing a Go framework, there's a lot of confusion
about what to use. The scene is very fragmented, and detailed
comparisons of different frameworks are still somewhat rare. Meantime,
how to handle dependencies and structure projects are big topics in
the Go community. We've liked using Gin for its speed,
accessibility, and usefulness in developing microservice
architectures. In creating Gin-OAuth2, we wanted to take fuller
advantage of Gin's capabilities and help other devs do likewise.

Gin-OAuth2 is expressive, flexible, and very easy to use. It allows you to:
- do OAuth2 authorization based on HTTP routing
- create router groups to place OAuth2 authorization on top, using HTTP verbs and passing them
- more easily decouple services by promoting a "say what to do, not how to do it" approach
- configure your REST API directly in the code (see the "Usage" example below)
- write your own authorization functions

## How OAuth 2 Works

If you're just starting out with OAuth2, you might find these
resources useful:

- [OAuth 2 Simplified](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2)
- [An Introduction to OAuth 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2)

## Requirements

- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- An OAuth2 Token provider (we recommend that you use your own,
  p.e. use [dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex))
- a Tokeninfo service (p.e. use [dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex))

Gin-OAuth2 uses the following [Go](https://golang.org/) packages as
dependencies:

* [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
* [glog](https://github.com/golang/glog)
* [gin-glog](https://github.com/zalando/gin-glog)

## Installation

Assuming you've installed Go and Gin, run this:

    go get github.com/zalando/gin-oauth2

## Usage

[This example](https://github.com/zalando/gin-oauth2/blob/master/example/zalando/main.go) shows you how to use Gin-OAuth2.

### Uid-Based Access

First, define your access triples to identify who has access to a
given resource. This snippet shows how to grant resource access to two
hypothetical employees:

        // from zalando package
        // type AccessTuple struct {
	//      Realm string // p.e. "employees", "services"
        //      Uid   string // UnixName
        //      Cn    string // RealName
        // }
        var USERS []zalando.AccessTuple = []zalando.AccessTuple{
	    {"/employees", "sszuecs", "Sandor Szücs"},
            {"/employees", "njuettner", "Nick Jüttner"},
        }

Next, define which Gin middlewares you use. The third line in this
snippet is a basic audit log:

	router := gin.New()
	router.Use(ginglog.Logger(3 * time.Second))
	router.Use(ginoauth2.RequestLogger([]string{"uid"}, "data"))
	router.Use(gin.Recovery())

Finally, define which type of access you grant to the defined
users. We'll use a router group, so that we can add a bunch of router
paths and HTTP verbs:

	privateUser := router.Group("/api/privateUser")
	privateUser.Use(ginoauth2.Auth(zalando.UidCheck(USERS), zalando.OAuth2Endpoint))
	privateUser.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
		if v, ok := c.Get("cn"); ok {
			c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": fmt.Sprintf("Hello from private for users to %s", v)})
		} else {
			c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "Hello from private for users without cn"})
		}
	})

#### Testing

To test, you can use curl:

        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8081/api/privateUser/
        {"message":"Hello from private for users to Sandor Szücs"}

### Team-Based Access

As with Uid-based access, define your access triples to identify who
has access to a given resource. With this snippet, you can grant resource
access to an entire team instead of individuals:

        var TEAMS []zalando.AccessTuple = []zalando.AccessTuple{
	    {"teams", "opensourceguild", "OpenSource Guild"},
	    {"teams", "tm", "Platform / System"},
	    {"teams", "teapot", "Platform / Cloud API"},
        }

Now define which Gin middlewares you use:

	router := gin.New()
	router.Use(ginglog.Logger(3 * time.Second))
	router.Use(ginoauth2.RequestLogger([]string{"uid"}, "data"))
	router.Use(gin.Recovery())

Lastly, define which type of access you grant to the defined
team. We'll use a router group again:

	privateGroup := router.Group("/api/privateGroup")
	privateGroup.Use(ginoauth2.Auth(zalando.GroupCheck(TEAMS), zalando.OAuth2Endpoint))
	privateGroup.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
		uid, okUid := c.Get("uid")
		if team, ok := c.Get("team"); ok && okUid {
			c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": fmt.Sprintf("Hello from private to %s member of %s", uid, team)})
		} else {
			c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "Hello from private for groups without uid and team"})
		}
	})

Once again, you can use curl to test:

        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8081/api/privateGroup/
        {"message":"Hello from private to sszuecs member of teapot"}

### Run Example Service

Run example service:

    % go run example/zalando/main.go -v=2 -logtostderr
    [GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
    - using env:   export GIN_MODE=release
    - using code:  gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)

Get an access token from your token provider (```oauth2.Endpoint.AuthURL```):

    % TOKEN=$(curl https://$USER:$PASSWORD@token.oauth2.corp.com/access_token)

Request:

    % curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8081/api/privateGroup/
    {"message":"Hello from private to sszuecs member of teapot"}

### Google-Based Access

As shown in [this great article](http://skarlso.github.io/2016/06/12/google-signin-with-go/) about Gin and Google signin, you have to create credentials for an "OAuth client ID." In your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), you will find "Credentials" in the "API Manager":

![Picture of Google Cloud Console showing API Manager](https://github.com/zalando/gin-oauth2/blob/feature/google-oauth/doc/gcp-credentials.png?raw=true)

You have to specify a path to your [clientid credential file](./example/google/test-clientid.google.json) and a slice of
scopes that you request for authorization.
You have also to specify the URL to get redirected to upon completion of the Google OAuth2.
Lastly, you have to choose a secret for the CookieStore and a session.
This OAuth2 flow is also known as [Authorization Code Flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1).

        redirectURL := "http://127.0.0.1:8081/auth/"
        credFile := "./example/google/test-clientid.google.json" // you have to build your own
	scopes := []string{
		"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
		// You have to select your own scope from here -> https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes#google_sign-in
	}
	secret := []byte("secret") //
	sessionName := "goquestsession"

	router := gin.Default()
	// init settings for google auth
	google.Setup(redirectURL, credFile, scopes, secret)
	router.Use(google.Session(sessionName))


After the base setup, register a login handler. You might want to implement it yourself (pull requests are welcome):

	router.GET("/login", google.LoginHandler)

With a publicly accessible login resource in place, we can protect a private router group accessibly only with a Google authorized session. Auth will save your user information in the Gin context bucket "user."

	// protected url group
	private := router.Group("/auth")
	private.Use(google.Auth())
	private.GET("/", UserInfoHandler)
	private.GET("/api", func(ctx *gin.Context) {
		ctx.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "Hello from private for groups"})
	})

	router.Run("127.0.0.1:8081")

A handler will fetch user information from the gin.Context that's stored in google.Auth.

        func UserInfoHandler(ctx *gin.Context) {
	        ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"Hello": "from private", "user": ctx.MustGet("user").(google.User)})
        }

#### Testing Google Auth

- Created your Google clientid stored in clientid.google.json similar to and grant redirect to example/google/test-clientid.google.json as described in the [article](http://skarlso.github.io/2016/06/12/google-signin-with-go/) mentioned before.
- run the server: ```% go run example/google/google.go -cred-file clientid.google.json```
- open [http://127.0.0.1:8081/login](http://127.0.0.1:8081/login) in your browser
- In your browser, follow the login, and choose your identity to login with
- You'll be redirected to the http://127.0.0.1:8081/auth endpoint, which should show your identity data
